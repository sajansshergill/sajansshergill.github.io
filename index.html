      <p>Hi! I‚Äôm Sajan Singh Shergill, a data-driven problem solver currently pursuing my Master‚Äôs in Data Science at Pace University. With over three years of experience in software quality assurance, I‚Äôve worked extensively in agile development environments across fintech and edtech domains. My foundation in QA has given me a unique edge ‚Äî a deep understanding of product usability, process optimization, and the discipline of testing things thoroughly before scaling. This background has shaped my approach as I transition into the world of data science and machine learning.</p>

      <p>Over the years, I‚Äôve grown passionate about transforming raw, complex data into insights that guide meaningful business decisions. Whether it's building predictive models to analyze customer churn or visualizing energy demand trends using Facebook Prophet, I enjoy solving real-world problems at the intersection of technology, analytics, and strategy. My hands-on experience spans tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel ‚Äî with projects ranging from political ad-spend analysis to food delivery profitability and infrastructure forecasting.</p>

      <p>I take pride in my ability to blend technical expertise with collaboration. Leading QA teams and working with cross-functional stakeholders have taught me the importance of communication, clarity, and empathy in tech. From automating testing suites to crafting dashboards that highlight financial outliers, I aim to deliver solutions that are not just smart, but also usable and scalable.</p>

      <p>Above all, I‚Äôm someone who learns fast, adapts quickly, and strives to make a positive impact. Whether I‚Äôm streamlining operational workflows, digging into messy datasets, or training machine learning models, I bring curiosity and drive to everything I do. I‚Äôm excited about opportunities where I can contribute to data-driven innovation and continue growing as a data professional.</p>
